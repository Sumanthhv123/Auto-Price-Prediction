pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### Key Libraries Used

- \`pandas\`
- \`numpy\`
- \`matplotlib\`
- \`seaborn\`
- \`scikit-learn\`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoPricePred.git
   cd AutoPricePred
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

3. Open the notebook:
   \`\`\`bash
   jupyter notebook AutoPricePred.ipynb
   \`\`\`

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

Models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score. The Random Forest Regressor performed best in this implementation.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

- Include cross-validation and ensemble methods
